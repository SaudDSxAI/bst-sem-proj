# Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++

## Overview
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. It supports insertion, deletion, and multiple tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder). The project demonstrates fundamental data structure concepts and recursive algorithms, reflecting my journey in mastering C++ and core computer science principles.

## Features
- **Node Insertion:** Add new nodes to the BST while maintaining its properties.
- **Node Deletion:** Remove nodes (leaf, one child, or two children) with correct tree restructuring.
- **Traversals:**
  - Inorder (Left, Root, Right)
  - Preorder (Root, Left, Right)
  - Postorder (Left, Right, Root)
- **Find Minimum:** Utility to find the minimum value node in a subtree.
- **Interactive Console:** User inputs data for insertion and deletion, with results displayed after each operation.

## How It Works
1. **Insert Nodes:** User enters values, which are inserted into the BST.
2. **Display Tree:** Inorder traversal prints the tree contents.
3. **Delete Node:** User specifies a value to delete; the tree is updated and displayed again.

## My Learning Journey
Through this project, I learned:
- The structure and properties of binary search trees.
- Recursive programming for tree operations.
- Handling edge cases in node deletion.
- The importance of clear, modular code for data structures.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Compile:** Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile `mybst.cpp`.
   - Example: `g++ mybst.cpp -o bst`
2. **Run:** Execute the compiled program.
   - Example: `./bst`
3. **Follow Prompts:** Enter node values to build the tree, then specify a node to delete.

## File Structure
- `Binary_search_tree/mybst.cpp`: Main source code for the BST implementation.
- `README.md`: Project overview, features, and instructions.
